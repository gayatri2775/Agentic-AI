# Agentic AI – Autonomous Task-Oriented AI Agent

## Project Description
This project implements an Agentic AI system that autonomously plans and executes a multi-step task. The AI agent searches for recent agriculture-related AI research papers, summarizes their key contributions, and stores the results in a structured format, demonstrating task planning, tool usage, and memory handling.

## Problem Statement
Design an Agentic AI system that can autonomously plan and execute a multi-step task using external tools.

## Features
- Task decomposition and planning
- Tool-based execution (search, summarization, storage)
- Context and memory handling
- Structured JSON output

## Technologies Used
- Python
- JSON for data storage

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Run the agent using:
   ```bash
   python agent.py
